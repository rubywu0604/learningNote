### 01Feb.2023- Hello Github :tada:
Today is my first time to push the file successfully to Github.

After several hours for researching.
Created ssh-key, checked the environment, saw __OhMyZsh__ been updated with pic

<img src="Image/OMZ.png" width="500" >

which inspires me to __keep going__. :smile:

I edit code in Atom, type command line in terminal, learn how to use MARKDOWN to edit README.

Finally, I know how to update file on Github through git config.

Thanks my mentor [@jerome1210](https://github.com/Jerome1210)
