      <h2 class="section-header">About Me</h2>
      <p> <li>Based on your answer in last question, why are you interested in that specific software development? What have you done to expose yourself to it so far? </li>
        <br>First, when I contacted with IT in Citi bank, I felt that their job was interesting. Also, my husband is an IOS software engineer with 8-year experience. Hence, I have been spirited by them and started to learn about basic knowledge of coding for a month. Then I found there is a great opportunity for me on App Works School. I really want to join this class to enhance my skill and have the opportunity to transfer my job to an engineer instead of being a staff in the bank.</p>
      <p> <li>What's the biggest achievement (or the most challenging thing) in your life? And how did you make it?</li>
        <br>To be honest, applying a job for engineer may be the biggest achievement to me I have ever tried. Because I major in insurance department in university and taking the jobs in the bank (Union Bank & Citi Bank) after graduated. I'm familiar with financial scopes instead of coding so far.  However, I don't want to be a self-limit person and willing to learn more, earn more, realize the ideal life. When I was thinking how to achieve it and find out the information on the internet. AppWorks School appeared on the web page. I really want to have a new life. So, I took apart to learn JavaScript after work, no matter how late it was, I took at least 1 hour to learn coding on the weekdays. In the weekends, I took the chance to learn more, consult with my husband and try to understand the computer world. If I can transfer to be a software engineer, that will be so grateful, and it will be my biggest achievement for sure.</p>
